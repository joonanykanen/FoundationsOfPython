#  FoundationsOfPython

This project consists of 2 main things: The Python course practical assignment of our university and a bunch of other fun programs I wrote. 
## Installation

You can run these programs using Python 3. I suggest downloading Python from [python.org](https://python.org) and running the programs in VS Code using Python extension.

```bash
  // For linux distros with apt as the package manager
  sudo apt install python3

  // Running the programs in terminal
  python3 example.py
```
    
## License

You can freely use these programs under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.


## Usage/Examples

If you have a wordlist of some kind and want to securely generate passphrases of any length, I suggest checking 
out XKCD-style passphrase.py. There is also interesting permutation analysis clocking examples for Computer Science homework.
